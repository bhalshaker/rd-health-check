# üß™ Health Check Research and Development (R&D) Project

This R&D proof-of-concept project explores the development of a standardized health check system tailored for Python-based applications. Its purpose is to detect the availability and accessibility of application dependencies and support robust service monitoring.

While the immediate outcome is not the creation of a reusable library, the core objective is to inform and guide future efforts toward developing a generic Python library that developers can integrate to assess application status, performance metrics, and service availability.

The concept will be demonstrated using FastAPI‚Äîa modern, high-performance web framework compatible with Python 3.11‚Äîalongside a standalone HTML page that displays the health check results in a user-friendly format. This approach illustrates both backend integration and frontend visualization, offering a blueprint for future adoption across diverse Python environments.

## ü¶Ø Core Feature Implementation Checklist

- [75%] Implement diagnostic routine to verify TCP connectivity to external endpoints based on hostname or IP address and designated port.
- [50%] Validate presence of all Python packages specified in the `requirements.txt` manifest.
- [25%] Conduct availability checks for remote HTTP-based APIs, ensuring availability of the service.
- [75%] Detect and confirm active mount status of filesystem targets essential to application runtime dependencies.

## ‚ú® Proof of Concept Implementation

### ‚öôÔ∏è FastAPI Routes

| HTTP Method | Endpoint         | Description                       | Who Can Access? | 
|-------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------|
| GET         | /health        | Returns overall health status of the health checks with a details list of each category       | Public  |
| GET         | /health/databases        | Returns overall health status of databases checklist a details list of each database       | Admin User  |
| GET         | /health/mountpoints        | Returns overall health status of the mount points health checks with a details list of each mount point       | Admin User   |
| GET         | /health/webservices        | Returns overall health status of the health checks of registered webservice api with a details list of each webservice       | Admin User   |

### üåê HTML Demo

* A **dropdown menu** with the following options: [All,Databases, Webservices, Mount points].
* A **submit button** that triggers the display of the selected category.
* A **status view** that shows the health status of the selected option.

## üöÄ Deployment and Usage Procedures

[üñ•Ô∏è Deploy the application on a bare-metal or virtual server and perform testing](howto/BAREMETAL.md "Deploy the application on a bare-metal or virtual server and perform testing")

[üì¶ Deploy the application on a container engine (e.g., Docker, Podman) and conduct testing](howto/BAREMETAL.md "Deploy the application on a container engine (e.g., Docker, Podman) and conduct testing")

[üìò Follow the documented procedures for application usage and operation](howto/USAGE_OPERATION.md "Follow the documented procedures for application usage and operation")


## üìã Run environemnt prerequisites

* üêç Python 3.11
* üê≥ Docker/ ü¶≠ Podman (Recommended to automate testing, otherwise allocating databases should be done manually)
