# 🚦 The Power of Automated Health Checks

The project's methodology is simple yet powerful: by automating routine checks for connectivity, resource availability, and dependency integrity, we can proactively identify and resolve issues before they escalate into service outages.

## ⚙️ Core Features and Technical Implementation

### 1. 🧠 Database Connectivity Health Check

A database is often the backbone of an application. This framework verifies its health by performing a direct TCP connection check—going beyond a basic ping to confirm that the application can successfully establish a handshake with the database server.

- **How it works:**  
  The native Python `socket` library is used to attempt a connection to the database's host and port. This low-level approach is efficient and provides a binary "yes" or "no" answer regarding basic connectivity.

- **Why it matters:**  
  This check helps catch common issues such as network segmentation, firewall restrictions, or an offline database server. It's a critical first step in diagnosing database-related failures.

### 2. 📦 Dependency and Driver Validation

Connectivity is meaningless without the correct drivers. This tool ensures that all required packages are present in the Python environment, eliminating surprises during runtime.

- **How it works:**  
  The tool reads the `requirements.txt` file and compares its contents against the installed packages using `pip freeze`. Any discrepancies are flagged to ensure a complete and functional setup.

- **Why it matters:**  
  This check prevents runtime errors caused by missing dependencies—a common pain point in multi-environment deployments (e.g., development, staging, production).

### 3. 💾 Mount Point and Disk Usage Monitoring

Applications relying on local or network-attached storage can fail if a drive is unmounted or full. This health check includes robust monitoring for such scenarios.

- **How it works:**  
  Python’s native libraries and standard terminal commands like `df` are used to inspect designated mount points. The check confirms accessibility and reports current disk usage percentages.

- **Why it matters:**  
  It proactively alerts administrators to potential disk space issues, helping prevent data write failures, application crashes, and other storage-related disruptions.

### 4. 🌐 Web Service Availability Check

Modern applications often depend on external APIs or internal microservices. This framework verifies their availability by attempting to establish a TCP connection.

- **How it works:**  
  Similar to the database check, the Python `socket` library is used to test connectivity to the target host and port. This confirms whether the service is actively listening for incoming connections.

- **Why it matters:**  
  This check quickly diagnoses network issues, misconfigured port forwarding, or offline services—making it essential for distributed systems and Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA).
