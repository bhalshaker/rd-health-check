# Health Check Research and Development (R&D) Project

This R&D proof-of-concept project explores the implementation of a standardized health check system tailored for Python-based applications. The goal is to design a reusable and generic framework that developers can integrate to monitor application status, performance, and service availability.

The solution will be demonstrated using FastAPIâ€”a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.11 and a standalone HTML page that presents the health check results in a user-friendly format. This setup aims to illustrate both backend integration and frontend visualization, serving as a blueprint for adoption in future projects across different Python environments.
