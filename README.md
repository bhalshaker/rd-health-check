# üß™ Health Check Research and Development (R&D) Project

This R&D proof-of-concept project explores the development of a standardized health check system tailored for Python-based applications. Its purpose is to detect the availability and accessibility of application dependencies and support robust service monitoring.

While the immediate outcome is not the creation of a reusable library, the core objective is to inform and guide future efforts toward developing a generic Python library that developers can integrate to assess application status, performance metrics, and service availability.

The concept will be demonstrated using FastAPI‚Äîa modern, high-performance web framework compatible with Python 3.11‚Äîalongside a standalone HTML page that displays the health check results in a user-friendly format. This approach illustrates both backend integration and frontend visualization, offering a blueprint for future adoption across diverse Python environments.

## ü¶Ø Core Feature Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Implement diagnostic routine to verify TCP connectivity to external endpoints based on hostname or IP address and designated port.
- [ ] Validate presence of all Python packages specified in the `requirements.txt` manifest.
- [ ] Conduct availability checks for remote HTTP-based APIs, ensuring availability of the service.
- [ ] Detect and confirm active mount status of filesystem targets essential to application runtime dependencies.
