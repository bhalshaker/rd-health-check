# 🧪 Health Check Research and Development (R&D) Project

This R&D proof-of-concept project explores the development of a standardized health check system tailored for Python-based applications. Its purpose is to detect the availability and accessibility of application dependencies and support robust service monitoring.

While the immediate outcome is not the creation of a reusable library, the core objective is to inform and guide future efforts toward developing a generic Python library that developers can integrate to assess application status, performance metrics, and service availability.

The concept will be demonstrated using FastAPI—a modern, high-performance web framework compatible with Python 3.11—alongside a standalone HTML page that displays the health check results in a user-friendly format. This approach illustrates both backend integration and frontend visualization, offering a blueprint for future adoption across diverse Python environments.

## 🦯 Core Feature Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Implement diagnostic routine to verify TCP connectivity to external endpoints based on hostname or IP address and designated port.
- [ ] Validate presence of all Python packages specified in the `requirements.txt` manifest.
- [ ] Conduct availability checks for remote HTTP-based APIs, ensuring availability of the service.
- [ ] Establish connectivity verification for dependent relational database management systems (RDBMS), confirming authentication and schema accessibility.
- [ ] Detect and confirm active mount status of filesystem targets essential to application runtime dependencies.

## Run environemnt prerequists

* 🐍 Python 3.11
* 🐳 Docker/ 🦭 Podman (Recommended to automate testing, otherwise allocating databases should be done manually)

## Libraries Used

### Python Application

* **FastAPI** -> Web framework for building APIs
* **Uvicorn** -> Production ASGI Server to run the web APIS
* **Pydantic** -> This library is for Json Body schemas using it would make validating json body and query parameters much easier
* **python-dotenv** -> load external .env file

### HTML Demo Page

* **Tailwind**
* **React**
* **Babel**

### Testing Libraries

* **Pytest** -> Framework library to test the application
* **pytest-html** -> Generate PyTest results in an HTML file
* **Selenium**
